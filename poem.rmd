Out of a pellucid brook  
 Pebbles round and smooth I took :  
 Like a jewel, every one  
 Caught a color from the sun, —  
 Ruby red and sapphire blue,  
 Emerald and onyx too,  
 Diamond and amethyst, —  
 Not a precious stone I missed :  
 Gems I held from every land  
 In the hollow of my hand.  
 Workman Water these had made ;  
 Patiently through sun and shade,  
 With the ripples of the rill  
 He had polished them until,  
 Smooth, symmetrical and bright,  
 Each one sparkling in the light  
 Showed within its burning heart  
 All the lapidary’s art ;  
 And the brook seemed thus to sing :  
 Patience conquers everything !
